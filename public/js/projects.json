					"The reason I wanted to start this project was because I wanted an app that made it easy to find cool places to visit in whatever city I might be in.",
				"learned":
					" I started this along with Skye 2 years ago in my first iteration of learning web development. In this case, I learned about AngularJS (the first version), animating state / routes with Angular Router and Animate.css. I also learned more about AJAX and working with an API. The APIs used for this project were the Geolocation API (to get the user's location) and Foursquare API to pull in data about the most popular places (Spaces) in the their current location."

					"Something about exploring the realm of instantaneous weather conditions intrigues me. And the bragging rights of creating your own weather app comes with it's own perks.",
				"learned":
					"Similar to Space, I learned more about AngularJS, APIs, and AJAX. Since, the weather information API I was using only worked with longitude and latitude coordinates (Dark Sky API), I had to find a way to convert the city the user typed into those. For that I decided to use the Google Maps API. I also learned a few things about Angular's two-way data binding system. For example, getting data back the Dark Sky API and then inserting it into the DOM. It definitely made the process a lot easier."

I now use this program almost everyday!",
				"learned":
					"Even though the script is only a few lines (which I'm looking to expand), it look some time to research. It was a ton of fun getting this to work, from searching for the right libraries, installing them correctly, and reading the Python docs, accidently writing JavaScript syntax instead of Python (which is a lot simpler in some ways to write than JavaScript). I learned how to loop through a directory with the OS library's Walk method, add and edit MP3 metadata with Mutagen, and how to open applications with Subprocess. The main takeaway from this project for me is how versatile programming knowledge is and how it can (somewhat) easily transferred to other language, even backend ones, with a few syntactic differences."
