				"img": "./public/img/writeup-imgs/space.png",
				"why":
					"The reason I wanted to start this project was because I wanted an app that made it easy to find cool places to visit in whatever city I might be in.",
				"learned":
					" I started this along with Skye 2 years ago in my first iteration of learning web development. In this case, I learned about AngularJS (the first version), animating state / routes with Angular Router and Animate.css. I also learned more about AJAX and working with an API. The APIs used for this project were the Geolocation API (to get the user's location) and Foursquare API to pull in data about the most popular places (Spaces) in the their current location."

				"why":
					"Something about exploring the realm of instantaneous weather conditions intrigues me. And the bragging rights of creating your own weather app comes with it's own perks.",
				"learned":
					"Similar to Space, I learned more about AngularJS, APIs, and AJAX. Since, the weather information API I was using only worked with longitude and latitude coordinates (Dark Sky API), I had to find a way to convert the city the user typed into those. For that I decided to use the Google Maps API. I also learned a few things about Angular's two-way data binding system. For example, getting data back the Dark Sky API and then inserting it into the DOM. It definitely made the process a lot easier."

					"Photira came about recently when I began learning React. One of the projects for my school Bov Academy was to create a photo gallery app with Handlebars, personally I'm not a huge fan of Handlebars (yet) so I decided it'd be a great time to learn to basics of React and try my hand at making my first React app.",
				"learned":
					"For the most part, React. Like getting data from child components and then changing the state. This part was the most confusing for me. But, eventually I got my head around the process of changing the state via a class method and then passing that method via props to the child component. I also learned about React's Lifecycle hooks and using them to save data (in Photira's instance, image URLs) to LocalStorage."

					"Instavu is another React project I built after learning more about ReactRouter and creating custom routes. Basically, Instavu allows you to build a wall of Instagram profiles and then see their latest posts on their individual Vu's. This was a very fun and useful project for me, mainly because I don't have an Instagram profile yet, and because I got to use the (unofficial) Instagram API.",
				"learned":
					"As noted above I learned a deeper understanding about ReactRouter. I learned how to refresh data stored in LocalStorage. For this stage in development for Instavu, I found LocalStorage to be adequate enough, but as I look to the future of it, I definitely see the limitations of it. I'm looking to migrate data to Firebase, or mLab very soon."

					"Oh man, Filmdova is by far one of my favorite projects I've done. Mainly, because I wrote the JavaScript for this project with <strong>vanilla</strong> JavaScript. No external frameworks or libraries (even though I tried to use my framework/library _Fusion, however I found getting ES6 to work with Gulp is a bit of a hassle than it is with Webpack). Even though there's Google and IMDB, I wanted to try my hand at designing and developing my own actor/actress app.",
				"learned":
					"I learned that using a vanilla JavaScript solution is not always the best way to write an app and sometimes (as cool and impressive as it is; in my opinion) can actually slowdown the process and make it troublesome. Especially when there's so many incredible frameworks and libraries available to use that solve those same problems for you. Simple things like clearing / refreshing the DOM are a bit tedious to do with vanilla JavaScript. I also learned clever (again in my opinion) ways of storing useful data within HTML attributes via data. I've used the data attribute before in other projects, but they've never been the backbone of project. I used them in a similar way React does with props, storing things like Actor's and credit IDs. That made it possible for the data to be cleanly used with AJAX calls to request more information about an Actor."

				"why":
					"The reason I created this is because while working with React itself is great, the setup and configuration is not. Setting up Webpack, having to configure it, and incorporating Babel, etc is not super fun so I needed a tool to help me quickly bootstrap  React projects. There's Create-React-App from Facebook, but I feel it's a lot of bloat and masks a lot of what's going on under the hood. The stack / workspace I use for these type of projects are React, Webpack, Sass, and NPM scripts so this template, with some other config reflects that.",
				"learned":
					"Here NPM Scripts play an important role in making it easy for developers to get up and running. It wasn't difficult to learn about NPM Scripts, which can be viewed as simply commands, but making sure everything is truly easy to get started with little setup overhead can be. It was important to keep in mind who would possibly be using this template and wanted make things fast and simple so the most fun part actually writing React app could begin as soon as possible."

I now use this program almost everyday!",
				"learned":
					"Even though the script is only a few lines (which I'm looking to expand), it look some time to research. It was a ton of fun getting this to work, from searching for the right libraries, installing them correctly, and reading the Python docs, accidently writing JavaScript syntax instead of Python (which is a lot simpler in some ways to write than JavaScript). I learned how to loop through a directory with the OS library's Walk method, add and edit MP3 metadata with Mutagen, and how to open applications with Subprocess. The main takeaway from this project for me is how versatile programming knowledge is and how it can (somewhat) easily transferred to other language, even backend ones, with a few syntactic differences."
